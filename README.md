# 🩹 Wound Segmentation for Healing Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on segmenting wound regions from medical images to assist in monitoring and predicting the healing process using deep learning techniques. The goal is to accurately detect wound boundaries and support healthcare professionals in tracking wound recovery over time.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Perform semantic segmentation of wounds in medical images.
- Utilize **U-Net** and **U-Net++** architectures for precise wound segmentation.
- Lay the groundwork for predicting wound healing progression.
- Build a framework that can be integrated into clinical support systems.

## 🧠 Deep Learning Models

- **U-Net**: Convolutional Neural Network architecture for biomedical image segmentation.
- **U-Net++**: An enhanced version with dense skip connections for improved accuracy.

## 📁 Dataset

- Contains wound images and corresponding segmentation masks.
- Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- Data is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

> **Note**: The dataset is not publicly included. You can use your own dataset or request access if applicable.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
